Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate  ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Be sure to download and zip the file to same path as your work path of R

A script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
